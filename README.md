## Description

The reason I created this project is because I wanted to keep track of my workouts. I have to memorize the last weight I used in order to properly increase the dumbbell weight. In addition to weight, I also want to keep track of dates. I felt I needed this app because I have to record these in each body part.

The status (rest, ready, lazy) is displayed according to the time elapsed from the date of the workout, so you can workout with recovery in mind. You can also register a weekly schedule. I named this app "Workout Manager" because these features help people who work out.

I struggle with managing state with useContext to keep ligin information because it caused some errors and bugs. And I had a hard time dealing with the time format. There's still some code that needs to be improved, so I'll refactor them.
